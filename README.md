# About Me
Hey! I'm Lavanya! 👋🏻 I'm a data scientist dedicated to finding insights in data and educating others in data analytics! Let's connect!

📊 I recently completed a Master’s in Data Science course at GUVI IIT-M, where I gained extensive knowledge and hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Deep Learning.

💻 I'm passionate about learning new things and taking on new challenges. I've been actively participating in online courses and hackathons to further enhance my skills in Data Science and Data Analytics.

🙂 A bit about me: I'm proactive and always ask, "What can I do to help and improve?" when faced with a problem. I enjoy collaborating with others to find innovative solutions and implement them for improvement. I believe in giving back to society and uplifting those around me.

💬 Message me to discuss: starting a career in Data Science, the resources I use for learning, and staying motivated when self-learning. You can also check out my Medium articles!
