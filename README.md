About ME,
Hey! I'm Lavanya! 👋🏻
I'm a Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer dedicated to turning data into actionable insights and sharing knowledge in data analytics and machine learning! 📊

🚀 Recently, I worked as an AI/ML Engineer at a startup, where I built intelligent systems, contributed to real-world AI projects, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to drive innovation using machine learning and deep learning.

🎓 I completed my Master’s in Data Science course at GUVI IIT-M, gaining strong theoretical and hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Data Analytics.

🔍 I’ve analyzed 50+ datasets and created a repository filled with real-time and live data science projects that showcase end-to-end workflows from data collection to deployment.

📚 I'm passionate about continuous learning. I actively take part in online courses, challenges on HackerRank, and build personal projects to keep sharpening my skills.

🙌 A bit about me: I'm proactive and always ask, "What can I do to help and improve?" when faced with challenges. I love working in teams, brainstorming innovative solutions, and implementing ideas that create impact. I also believe in sharing knowledge and uplifting those around me.
