# About Me
Hey! I'm Lavanya! 👋🏻 I'm a data scientist dedicated to finding insights in data and educating others in data analytics! Let's connect!

📊 I was first introduced to the world of Data Analytics while working in the IT sector for a Fortune 500 company. Although, at that time, the term Data Science wasn’t this famous, I understood that any industry generated a lot of data and not tapping into it is a waste of valuable insights. I leveraged automation and app data to generate insights, which sparked my interest in this field.

🔬 Fast forward to now, I am currently pursuing my Master’s at Concordia University in Software Engineering. I have taken various courses expanding my horizon in the fields of Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics.

💻 Always eager to learn new things and take up new challenges, I am currently taking various online courses and participating in hackathons to gain experience in the field of Data Science and Data Analytics. I am also exploring multiple domains to further enhance my skills and choose where I want to end up in the future.

🙂 A little about my personality: I am the type of person who will ask, “What can I do to help and improve?” when presented with a problem and will pitch in whenever needed to find out-of-the-box solutions to existing processes. I am energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see improvement. I strongly believe in giving back to society and uplifting everyone around me.

💬 Message me to talk about: how to get started in Data Science, what's it like pursuing a master’s at Concordia or in Canada, what resources I am using for my learning, and how to stay motivated when you are self-learning even if you aren’t from a computer science background.
